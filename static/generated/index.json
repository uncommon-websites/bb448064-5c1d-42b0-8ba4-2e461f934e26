    "prompt": "A professional athlete in their twenties, relaxed and smiling, celebrates a personal achievement in a bright, modern gym with natural daylight streaming through large windows. The scene is photographed in a documentary style with rich, moody shadows and high contrast, capturing the authenticity of the moment. The athlete is surrounded by subtle gym details—free weights, benches, and textured flooring—framed with architectural elements and negative space to create layered depth. The atmosphere feels intimate and energetic, with body language that suggests genuine enjoyment and quiet confidence rather than performative excitement. The lighting mixes warm highlights and cool blue undertones, evoking the anticipation and discovery of a unique, personal milestone. No tech, screens, text, or posters in the environment; focus on real, tangible elements only.",
